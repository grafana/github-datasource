{{< admonition type="note" >}}
To work around [GitHub's rate limiting](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28), the plugin caches requests aggressively.

This can mean that it takes up to five minutes for a new pull request, commit, or issue to show up in a query.
