# Create variable with GitHub data source plugin for Grafana

A [variable](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/) is a placeholder for a value that you can use in dashboard queries.

Variables allow you to create more interactive and dynamic dashboards by replacing hard-coded values with dynamic options. They are displayed as dropdown lists at the top of the dashboard, making it easy to change the data being displayed.

**Example**

Here is an example of creating a dashboard variable:

You can reference them inside queries, allowing users to configure parameters such as `Query` or `Repository`.
