Milestone titles can be anything and are therefore parsed as a string. This means sorting by title may appear incorrect if you have numeric milestones, for example: `12.0.0`. [Transformations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/transform-data/) can be used to change the data type in this scenario.
