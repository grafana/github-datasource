## Sample Dashboard

For documentation on importing dashboards, check out the documentation on [grafana.com](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/reference/export_import/#importing-a-dashboard)

The sample dashboard can be obtained from either of two places.

1. From the Grafana dashboards page [located here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14000)

2. From the official [repository](https://github.com/grafana/github-datasource/)

If loading it from the official repository, open Grafana and click "Import Dashboard".

Copy the JSON in `./src/dashboards/dashboard.json`, and paste it into the "Import via panel json" box.
